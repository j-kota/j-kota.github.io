<h2 style="color: #800080;">Background:</h2>
<p>I do research involving mathematics for engineering applications. Recently, I've been interested in developing applied optimization frameworks for artificial intelligence and strategic planning. I'm currently working in the intersection of machine learning and discrete optimization, where my goal is develop fast approximations to hard scheduling problems via learning-based methods.</p>
<p>I'm now pursuing my PhD in computer science at Syracuse University, where I'm advised by Prof. Ferdinando Fioretto.</p>
