<p> My research draws from topics in mathematical optimization and machine learning. My current focus is on the integration of predictive and decision-making models from these two fields, aimed toward systems that can learn from empirical data to make complex decisions. My research interests include Operations Research and Optimization, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and especially the intersections of these fields. My doctoral thesis work has focused on deep learning models that utilize constrained optimization submodels for structured representations, and learning to solve hard decision problems. I received B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from the University at Buffalo and Stony Brook University, before working in operations research for industrial planning at the Institute for Defense Analyses.
